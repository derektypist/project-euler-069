# Project Euler 069 - Totient Maximum

Euler's Totient function, &phi;(n), sometimes called the phi function, is used to determine the number of numbers less than n which are relatively prime to n.  For example, as 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, and 8, are all less than nine and relatively prime to nine &phi;(9) = 6.
